    <h1>Issue with your addon <span class="addon_name">[Your addon]</span>
    </h1>
    <p>Super Addon Manager can't check for updates for your addon
        <span class="addon_name">[Your addon]</span>.
    </p>

    <h2>What's the problem?</h2>
    <p id="non-dev-friendly-issue-description">Your Addon <span class="addon_name">[Your addon]</span> doesn't support
        Super Addon
        Manager and can't be updated automatically. For Super Addon Manager to work, it's necessary that developers
        enable support for it. The developers of <span class="addon_name">[Your addon]</span> probably don't even know
        about Super Addon Manager yet, so it's time to tell them.</p>

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
After using Blender for a while now (including your addon), I've noticed that addon maintenance is a mess. I have multiple addons installed, and I'm not able to keep track of new versions for all of them. I'm using the Super Addon Manager by Blender Defender (https://github.com/BlenderDefender/SuperAddonManager) to do the task of updating ALL of my Addons from a SINGLE PLACE, but it relies on addon developers enabling support for it.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be great if you could activate support for it. Doing so is easy, 100% risk-free (no code added to your addon), and platform-independent. You can find a detailed description for enabling support for Super Addon Manager in the documentation: https://github.com/BlenderDefender/SuperAddonManager/wiki/implementation/

**Steps I have taken**
- [ ] Super Addon Manager is up to date.
- [ ] Your addon is up to date.
- [ ] Checked that this issue hasn't been reported already.
