**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
After using Blender for a while now (including your addon),
I've noticed that addon maintenance is a mess. I have multiple addons
installed, and I'm not able to keep track of new versions for all of them. I'm
using the Super Addon Manager by Blender Defender (https://github.com/BlenderDefender/SuperAddonManager)
to do the task of updating ALL of my Addons from a SINGLE PLACE, but it relies
on addon developers enabling support for it.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
It would be great if you could activate support for it. Doing so is easy, 100%
risk-free (no code added to your addon), and platform-independent. You can find
a detailed description for enabling support for Super Addon Manager in the
documentation: https://github.com/BlenderDefender/SuperAddonManager/wiki/implementation/

**Steps I have taken**
- [ ] Super Addon Manager is up to date.
- [ ] Your addon is up to date.
- [ ] Checked that this issue hasn't been reported already.
