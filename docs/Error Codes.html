          Many things can go wrong with this addon, since Super Addon Manager
          can't control how Developers implement support for it. Therefore,
          Super Addon Manager tries to determine these issues and return an
          error code that triggers a customized template issue report.

                Body: <br />
                **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please
                describe.**<br />
                After using Blender for a while now (including your addon), I've
                noticed that addon maintenance is a mess. I have {ADDON_COUNT}
                addons installed, and I'm not able to keep track of new versions
                for all of them. I'm using the Super Addon Manager by Blender
                Defender (https://github.com/BlenderDefender/SuperAddonManager)
                to do the task of updating ALL of my Addons from a SINGLE PLACE,
                but it relies on the developers enabling support for it.<br />
                <br />
                **Describe the solution you'd like**<br />
                It would be great if you could activate support for it. Doing so
                is easy, 100% risk-free (No code added to your addon), and
                platform-independent. You can find a detailed description for
                enabling support for Super Addon Manager on their documentation:

                Thank you for enabling support for the Super Addon Manager.
                Unfortunately, something is wrong with the Implementation: In
                the bl_info dictionary, a parameter called 'version' should be
                set. This parameter is not set, misspelled or contains an
                invalid datatype (Only integers, floats and numbers in strings
                can be converted to integers), so Super Addon Manager can't
                check for new versions. Thank you for having a look at this :)

                Unfortunately, something is wrong with the Implementation: In

                ({ENDPOINT_URL}), so Super Addon Manager can't check for new
