Many things can go wrong with this addon, since Super Addon Manager can't control how Developers
implement support for it. Therefore, Super Addon Manager tries to determine these issues and return
an error code that triggers a customized template issue report.

This is a list of all Error codes, their status and the issue report template they trigger:

Please describe.** </br> After using Blender for a while now (including your addon), I've noticed that addon maintenance is a mess. I have {addon_count} addons installed, and I'm not able to keep track of new versions for all of them. I'm using the Super Addon Manager by Blender Defender (https://github.com/BlenderDefender/SuperAddonManager) to do the task of updating ALL of my Addons from a SINGLE PLACE, but it relies on the developers enabling support for it. </br> </br> **Describe the solution you'd like\*\* </br> It would be great if you could activate support for it. Doing so is easy, 100% code-free (no risk of accidentaly breaking your addon), and platform-independent. You can find a detailed description for enabling support for Super Addon Manager on their documentation: https//TODO |

Unfortunately, something is wrong with the Implementation: In the bl_info dictionary, a parameter called 'version' should be set. This parameter is not set, misspelled or contains an invalid datatype (Only integers, floats and numbers in strings can be converted to integers), so Super Addon Manager can't check for new versions.
