1.: Get Blender Addons Path. --> PreferencesFilePaths.script_directory//addons or from bpy.utils.script_paths()
2.: CHECK FOR SuperAddonManager Update!
3.: Iterate through all folders and look for "endpoint_url" in bl_info
4.: Read bl_info, make a request to endpoint_url, compare the version numbers.
5.: Download and install all Auto-Download Addons and display the download URL's for non Auto-Download Addons


Auto Issue Report:
!!!INCLUDE THRESHOLD FOR LOWER VALUES (maybe 15)!!! I have 50 addons installed, and I'm not able to keep track of new versions for all of them.

Checklist:
- Updated Addon
- Updated SuperAddonManager
- Issue still exists
- Issue hasn't been reported

Maybe a note at the end (Auto Generated by SuperAddonManager)

Optional for developers:
    Snippet in the Addon Prefs saying that SuperAddonManager is supported.
    C.preferences.addons --> Check that SuperAddonManager isn't installed AND enabled yet


Schema Versions in the JSON file

Minimum and Maximum Blender version --> Maybe a Maximum Blender version is not necessary, since addons, that are actively developed should always work with the latest Blender version. This would make a maximum version obsolete.
Then a minimum Blender version would be enough to not update the Addon on older Blender Versions.

Maybe save backup copies (of the addons) for (a) downgrade option(s)

Try to read the version_info out of bl_info  --> Can be done via sys.modules[module].bl_info
